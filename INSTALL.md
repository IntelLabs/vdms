## Installation

Here is the detailed process of installation of VDMS dependencies.

## Dependencies

    sudo apt-get install wget
    sudo apt-get install scons
    sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
    sudo apt-get install automake libtool curl make g++ unzip libgtest-dev
    sudo apt-get install cmake wget zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libssl-dev liblz4-dev
    sudo apt-get install libtbb2 libtbb-dev
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev


### Install gtest

Unfortunately apt doesn't build gtest;
you need to do the following steps to get it to work correctly:

    cd /usr/src/gtest/
    sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
    sudo make
    sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

### Protobuf

 Google Protobufs. Default install location is /usr/local.

    git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
    cd protobuf/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfg

**Note**: protobuf v3.9+ is required
(previous versions cause problems in some systems)

### [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

Below are instructions for installing OpenCV v3.3.1.
It may also work with newer versions of OpenCV.

    wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.3.1.zip
    unzip 3.3.1.zip
    cd 3.3.1
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    make -j
    sudo make install

**Note**: When using videos, and getting the following error: "Unable to stop the stream: Inappropriate ioctl for device", you may need to include more flags when compiling OpenCV. Follow these instructions ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41200201/opencv-unable-to-stop-the-stream-inappropriate-ioctl-for-device)):

    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev

    // Rebuild OpenCV with the following commands:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local  -D WITH_FFMPEG=ON -D WITH_TBB=ON -D WITH_GTK=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D WITH_OPENGL=ON -D WITH_CUBLAS=ON -DWITH_QT=OFF -DCUDA_NVCC_FLAGS="-D_FORCE_INLINES" ..
    make -j
    sudo make install

### [TileDB](https://tiledb.io/)
VDMS works with TileDB v1.3.1.
The directions below will help you install TileDB v1.3.1 from source.
You can also follow the directions listed
[here](https://docs.tiledb.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Build TileDB

    git clone https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB
    cd TileDB
    git checkout 1.3.1
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local/
    make -j
    sudo make install-tiledb

### [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
Facebook Faiss library for similarity search, used as alternitive engines.
VDMS works with Faiss v1.4.0.

    wget https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/archive/v1.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf v1.4.0.tar.gz
    cd faiss-1.4.0
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make -j

You may need to change some flags in the CMakeFile depending on
configurations on your system.

Things that we have needed to change in CMakeLists.txt:
* If your system doesn't have a GPU, make sure that BUILD_WITH_GPU is OFF
* You may need to add -msse4 to set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
* Change the add_library call to be SHARED instead of STATIC

This library does not offer an install. Make sure you move .h files
to /usr/lib/include/faiss or /usr/local/lib/include/faiss,
and make sure you make the library (libfaiss.so) is available system-wide
Or follow instructions
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/v1.2.1/INSTALL.md)

### Valijson
  * git clone https://github.com/tristanpenman/valijson.git
  * cd valijson
  * cp -r include/* /usr/local/include (may need to run as sudo)
  * This is a headers-only library, no compilation/installation necessary

### Persistent Memory Graph Database (PMGD)
  * Download version 2.0.0 from: https://github.com/IntelLabs/pmgd/releases
  * Follow installation instructions


## Compilation

    git clone https://github.com/intellabs/vdms
    // Or download a release.

    cd vdms
    scons [FLAGS]

Flag | Explanation
------------ | -------------
--no-server | Compiles client libraries (C++/Python) only. (will not compile neither server nor tests)
--timing    | Compiles server with chronos for internal timing, experimental.
-jX         | Compiles in parallel, using X cores
INTEL_PATH=path  | Path to the root folder containing pmgd and vcl. Default is "./" which is pmgd and vcl inside vdms folder. Example: scons INTEL_PATH=/opt/intel/
--prefix    | Specify the installation location (see Installation below)


## Installation

### Installing VDMS Server + Libraries

By default, VDMS will build the server binary and
libraries, but will not install them in the sytem.

You can install the VDMS server + libraries in your system by running:

    sudo scons install

By defaul, the installation prefix is "/usr/local",
and the VDMS server and libraries at "/usr/local/bin" and
"/usr/local/lib", respectively.

You can also remove (uninstall) VDMS files from your system by running:

    sudo scons install -c

You can choose to install VDMS server and libraries in a
location of your choice by using the --prefix flag.

    sudo scons install --prefix=/tmp/

In this example, VDMS server will be installed at /tmp/bin, and the
libraries will be installed at /tmp/lib.

To remove (uninstall) VDMS files from a specified location by running:

    sudo scons install -c --prefix=/tmp

### Python Client Module

VDMS offers the Python Client Module through the pip package manager,
and it is compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.3+.
pip (or pip2 and pip3) will automatically install dependencies (protobuf).

    pip install vdms

### Running The VDMS Server

The config-vdms.json file contains the configuration of the server.
Some of the parameters include the TCP port that will be use for incoming
connections, maximun number of simultaneous clients, and paths to the
folders where data/metadata will be stored.

We provide a script (run_server.sh) that will create some default directories,
corresponding the default values in the config-vdms.json.

To run the server using the default directories and port, simply run:

    sh run_server.sh


install qtwayland and cmake version > 3.18
may need to remove libfaiss.so to use latest version
