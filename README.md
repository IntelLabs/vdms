Athena: Your Favourite Visual Data Management System
-----------

Athena is a tiered storage design to enable storing and processing of large
scale visual data. We use an in-persistent-memory graph database developed in
our team called Jarvis Lake as the metadata tier and are exploring the use of
TileDB and other formats for images and videos as part of our Visual Compute
Library (VCL). This project will research the use of a scalable multi-node
graph based metadata store as part of a hierarchical storage framework
specifically aimed at processing visual data, and also it includes an
investigation into the right hardware and software optimizations to store and
efficiently access large scale (pre-processed) visual data.
